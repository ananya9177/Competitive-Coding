# Rotate List

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

 

### Example 1:
![rotate1](https://github.com/ananya9177/Competitive-Coding/assets/151428838/82bb4c27-bd5b-4b44-9612-f3f3174ea251)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
```
### Example 2:
![roate2](https://github.com/ananya9177/Competitive-Coding/assets/151428838/eeb416ef-047a-4ad3-b545-52ea9f84ee58)

```
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100

0 <= k <= 2 * 109
