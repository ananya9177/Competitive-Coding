# Middle of the Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

### Example 1:
![lc-midlist1](https://github.com/ananya9177/Competitive-Coding/assets/151428838/8ac49ab3-2bb9-41a1-99a0-d1f5e5b4760b)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
```
**Explanation:** The middle node of the list is node 3.

### Example 2:
![lc-midlist2](https://github.com/ananya9177/Competitive-Coding/assets/151428838/fe7fe16f-3054-49e0-bbf6-4e30bf31ea7d)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
```
**Explanation:** Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 
**Constraints:**

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].

1 <= Node.val <= 100
